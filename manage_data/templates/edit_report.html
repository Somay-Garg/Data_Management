Further, the assessment of students learning in subsequent years is based on academic performance, level of alertness, participation in discussions, performance in class assignments and evaluation based on their mid-terms. These are escalated by observations made by mentors.

                                            College has a transparent and continuous internal assessment system. 25 marks in each paper are awarded through internal assessment while the remaining 75 are awarded by University-appointed examiners on the basis of performance of students in semester-end examinations.

                                            5% of the marks are awarded on the basis of attendance and assignments, presentations, and projects. Attendance is calculated as per university rules. A student needs to attend at least 75% of the classes in order to appear in the end-semester examination. Teachers mostly assign innovative projects to students to develop their creative skills and to engage them in critical thinking and problem solving. 
                                            <br><br>

MSIT offers a number of B.TECH in different disciplines with each having has sufficient weightage of fundamental & amp. This provides a strong correlation between Course Outcomes (COs) and Program Outcomes (POs) to develop necessary skills in students to make them proficient engineer. To keep track of how and where program outcomes are addressed in the curriculum, the university curriculum is grouped into different academic components at the institute level. The specific learning outcomes of various courses are built into the curriculum of each discipline and are available on the website.

                                            Teachers inculcate among students a quest for knowledge that lasts for a lifetime while simultaneously training them in the art of self-learning. We impart the attitude to keep learning, remain updated and readily adopt new developments in technology and in their subject matter. Students are taught to identify, formulate, and analyze real life problems, design and develop solutions and reach valid conclusions using basic principles of their subjects.

                                                            MSIT has consistently produced alumni who have distinguished themselves and are presently placed in reputed positions. Distinguished alumni are invited on annual day function for inspiring students. Such reputed alumni can be taken as an indicator of course/programme outcomes and the level of teaching learning in the institution. Students are encouraged to pursue higher studies and a number of them do so, both in India and abroad.

                                            Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology believes in creating an ambience that encourages students regularly to serve their best efforts in the neighbourhood community and develop a sense of communal & social responsibility. Extension activities can be proven greatly effective in sensitising students to social issues. The National Service Scheme (NSS) unit, the eco-club, the drama society, and the music society timely organise several programmes to promote the concept and practice of social responsibility. Some extensive activities organised are:

                                            Extension activities not only ingrain a sense of communal duty but also widely inspire young masses to pursue humanitarian practices in several fields. Moreover, following the notion, some of our students served at various places:

                                            MSIT believes in this saying by Maria Montessori and strongly upholds that holistic growth of students is possible only when we give a student a platform to express themselves in their areas of interest other than the academic front. We have several societies and SIGs run and managed by Student’s coordinator and faculty members. Students play a major role in the execution of these societies, and the role of the faculty is to mentor the student organizers. Various Societies are namely: IEEE, TechSoc, Prakriti/ NSS, Mutant, Developer Student Club. The institute of electrical and electronic engineers(IEEE) is a global professional association of engineers from across the world. IEEE is the foremost authority when it comes to research and in any field of engineering. It provides a platform to be exposed to advancements in technologies and cultivates a spirit of innovations in them. The IEEE student branch carries out various programs within the college which entail technical project exhibitions, summer project internships, and various other such programs. Special interest groups (SIGs) wherein students educate as well as learn from their peers are encouraged and carried out by the IEEE student branch. Various seminar talks, workshops and webinars are also conducted by the student branch. IEEE MSIT believes in holistic development and hence supports and conducts cultural events and SIGs as well. TechSoc, the technical society of MSIT was formed by the amalgamation of various technical clubs pre-existent in the college. This was done to channelize the scattered efforts and to provide a common platform that catered to the technical needs of the students. TechSoc serves its audience by organizing various events in the form of speaker sessions, technical seminars, and hands-on workshops on subjects from various domains. PRAKRITI MSIT To emphasize and increase the consciousness and awareness towards the environment and ecosystem, a group of students of MSIT came together to form Prakriti- The humanitarian and environmental society of MSIT. Established on 3rd March 2010 and since then the club is constantly working to make the mass youth aware of the ecosystem. Prakriti has gained a lot of appreciation and fame, even on a global level. It has provided the students with the opportunities to develop problem-solving, decision making and leadership skills. Being a not-for-profit organization, Prakriti always works to involve mass participation in planning and implementing the projects. Prakriti also stands to support various NGOs (like Goonj) and rural and urban communities (like Lion’s Club) that work towards the progress of society. Developer Student Club Developer Student Club, Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology (DSC-MSIT) is a community of college students powered by Google. DSC MSIT helps students to grow with the latest technology trends and student opportunities. This community provides a peer-to-peer learning environment while building solutions for community and local businesses. Solutions built by a developer student club are supported by Google Developer technologies.

In this audit the statutory dues and their challans is checked to see that all the statutory requirements are met on time. Monthly reconciliations of bank, cash and ledgers is being done under this audit. All the fee receipts are checked with the strength of the students. In this audit, a special separate audit was conducted in the month of December every year wherein all the stocks and fixed assets are checked and verified. The External/Statutory audit is being done on annual basis. This is basically a Balance Sheet audit wherein the basic vouching is checked on random basis and the main stress was on the Statutory Compliances. In this audit it is to be seen that all the accepted accounting standards are being followed and are to be shown in the Balance Sheet. The auditors have to see that the Balance Sheet and Income Expenditure account gives a true and fair view of the accounts. The final Balance Sheet is signed by the statutory auditors.

In this regard, workshops, seminars are conducted by Special Interest Groups to motivate the students and enable them to explore new technical areas. In addition, in-house training facility is provided to the students during summer vacation. These steps ensure outcome based quality technical education. Regular audits are conducted internally to guarantee proper maintenance of NBA norms and quality education standards.
